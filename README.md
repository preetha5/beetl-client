## Description
Beetl is a bug tracking system for development teams. My intention was to create a prototype for a lightweight issue tracking system that small hardware/software teams can use. Having used multiple bug tracking systems my self in prior teams, I feel they are huge complex and bulky systems mostly for large enterprises. Beetl on the other hand has the advantages of React and Node for fast access and reduced http requests making it an idea choice for small-midsize teams.

 The admin user has the sole access to add projects and other team users into the account they have created. The developer or testers will have their own logins and their personalized dashboard view showing bugs they are working on. The Beetl app is planning to be scaled to have conditional status changes and email notifications while bug are being assigned to different users.
